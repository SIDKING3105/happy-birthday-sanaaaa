# Happy Birthday Sana - Website (Vite + React + Tailwind)

## What this is
A ready-to-deploy React site made for Sana's birthday. Drop your photos into the `public` folder as:
- `sana1.jpg`
- `sana2.jpg`
- `sana3.jpg`
- `sana4.jpg`
- `sana5.jpg`
- `sana6.jpg`

Then push to GitHub and import the repo to Vercel for a live link.

## Run locally
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open the URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173).

## Deploy to Vercel
1. Create a GitHub repo and push this project.
2. In Vercel, click **New Project** â†’ import the repo.
3. Vercel auto-detects Vite and deploys. You'll get a public link to share.

## Notes
- The project includes placeholder images (small colored images). Replace them with your real photos in `/public`.
